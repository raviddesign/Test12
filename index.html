							<p>Born in 1967, raised in Deer Park, NY. It was 3rd grade and Buz was playing the viola in the school orchestra, he quickly moved on to drums and at age 10 started playing guitar. Immediatly writing original material. In 1984 the first band emerged, FALL OUT. This band led to the hair metal band MASQUERADE, who in the same year transformed to a speed/death/thrash band called VIOLENT AGGRESSION. Popularity high these were good times for Buz. But VIOLENT AGGRESSION split and from the ashes came RENEGADE TRIP, a jam band. Buz worked on many side projects to fill the void in other genres. In 1992 RENEGADE TRIP called it quits and the rap duo of BIG HOOBIE D & BUZ BOMB were born. 4 years in Buz went solo. 1996 and 1999 where the only time any music had been created. But in 2013 Buz came back to the scene and released over 10 albums, and the entire catalog became available online. Booking and promoting shows came Buz's way. And producing music for up and coming artists. Buz began a radio show, created 2 webseries's one 80 episodes strong. Filmmaking then came into focus and Buz created a horror trilogy about a character named Dr. Benway. This psychotic killer sought after supernatural abilities to enter his victims dreams and then murder them the next day. The trilogy is a testamnet to the hard work and creative input Buz is capable of producing and directing without the assistance of anyone, except the actors. Buz is also an author and has a published book THEY CALL HER CHRISTINA and the follow up RAIN OF TERROR is now half way written, will it be published we'll see. There also is a 6 part horror screenplay written. Immersed in all he does Buz is a true multi faceted talent who seems to shine no matter the direction he takes in the entertainment industry. His 250 videos can be found on you tube, and his entire catalog of music on bandcamp. Focused, determined, talented, unstoppable. Buz has had one hell of a career, and it seems it's just begun.</p>

				On his 11th solo album Buz Bomb digs deep into different genres showing he can handle the expansion of his sound. Fallin' took longer than any album produced by him and has features with Second-Nature (England) and Red Cabbage (Maine), which further propels the sound to a myriad of different places. The album opens with REALITY BASED SITUATION, a floydian departure introducing the album. The title track is a banger that talks about falling in love and staying in love regardless of the obstacles. LOCKED UP BEHIND 32 BARS is a straight up rap track where Buz takes on a new attack style that is full of metaphors and punchlines. MONSTERS is a dubstep type rap track with the feature of Second-Nature. FLOW talks about having creative block and how to achieve despite the pressures. ONE MORE CHANCE is a slower groove that showcases Buz's ability to work his vocals under any circumstance and beat. LIGHT IT UP is a straight up marijuana celebration track, which is becoming a constant inspiration to his work. DROWN is again a slower track reminiscent of country music. TOUCH THE STARS talks of reaching to achieve the best you can. LITTLE DO YOU KNOW is a feature track with Nicky Scarz (Philadelphia), MJ Holliday (Long Island) and EZ Bluez (Conneticut), the four traversed the miles between them to come together and create a magical song. HERE WE GO is the only metal track on the album and it's a rocker. GOODBYE MY LOVE is a fitting close to the album delving deep into the loss of a loved one and how it's time to say goodbye, very sad track. Whether he is bopping through some hip hop or getting very poetic with his lyrics, he is a man of great talent and this album shopwcases him at his best and at the same time most fruitful in his exploration of styles and the commitment in making an album to be remmembered. He is one of a kind and his adoring fans would agree, great job, "That's the best music youve ever made."
